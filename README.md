# NotebookLM-Experiment
This repository documents my experiment with Google’s NotebookLM, where I explored the tool’s ability to summarize, answer questions, connect topics, and provide a study guide based on uploaded documents.

---

## Experiment Overview

In this experiment, I tested several capabilities of NotebookLM:
1. **Summarization** - Summarizing complex text into concise explanations.
2. **Question Answering** - Providing detailed answers based on uploaded sources.
3. **Concept Connections** - Connecting information across different documents.
4. **Study Guide Generation** - Organizing content into a helpful study guide.

Each section below shows examples of these capabilities using Dialogflow CX tutorial materials.

## Demonstration of Key Capabilities

### 1. Question Answering Example

**Question**: "How to create a chatbot?"

**NotebookLM Output**:
> Here are some steps on how to create a chatbot using Dialogflow CX, based on the provided source:
> 
> - **Create a Dialogflow CX Project**:
>   - Log in to the Dialogflow CX Console.
>   - Create a new project and enable the Dialogflow API.
>   - Create an agent, specifying your desired region and time zone.
> - **Build the Conversational Flow**:
>   - **Flows**: Define conversation topics and paths (e.g., ordering in a pizza delivery chatbot).
>   - **Pages**: Represent states in a conversation, collecting information like pizza type, size, and toppings.
>   - **Intents**: Handle user intents, such as "Yes" or "No" in a Coffee page.
>   - **Entities**: Extract specific data, like types of vegetables in a grocery chatbot.
>   - **Parameters**: Store values from the user.
>   - **Forms**: Collect multiple parameters in a structured manner.
>   - **Fulfillment**: Configure agent responses, such as "Would you like some coffee?" in the Coffee page.
>   - **State Handlers**: Manage conversation flow through routes and event handlers.
> - **Integrations**: Connect with platforms like Google Assistant or Facebook Messenger.
> - **Test and Deploy**: Use the testing tool in Dialogflow CX Console, and deploy once ready.

### 2. Summarization Example

**Prompt**: "Summarize the content."

**NotebookLM Output**:
> **Dialogflow CX Basics**: The sources provide an overview of Dialogflow CX, a platform for creating conversational AI like chatbots and voice assistants.
>
> - **Agents**: Virtual agents handle user interactions, similar to human call center agents.
> - **Flows**: Organize conversations into topics, with turns where agents gather information.
> - **Pages**: Manage conversation states within each flow.
> - **Entities**: Extract data types like dates or times from user input.
> - **Parameters**: Capture values provided by users for structured responses.
> - **Forms**: Collect parameters in a multi-turn conversation.
> - **Intents**: Identify the purpose of each user interaction.
> - **Webhooks**: Connect to backend services for dynamic responses.
> - **Fulfillment**: Generates responses using static replies, webhooks, or parameters.
> - **State Handlers**: Direct conversation flow based on intents and conditions.
> - **Integrations**: Connect Dialogflow CX to platforms like Google Assistant.

**Summarization Example**

### 3. Connecting Concepts Example

**Prompt**: "Connect these two documents."

**NotebookLM Output**:
> Connecting the Tutorials:
> - The first tutorial, "BUS5001-Workshop-Wk10-DialogFlowCX.pdf," introduces foundational Dialogflow CX concepts, including agents, flows, and state handlers. It walks through creating a basic "Breakfast Bot."
> - The second tutorial, "BUS5001-Week11-DialogFlowCX-II.pdf," builds on these basics by integrating data from external sources, like a restaurant menu stored in a data store. This expands the chatbot's functionality to offer more complex interactions, such as guiding the user through ordering items and calculating prices.
> - Conclusion: Together, these tutorials provide a comprehensive guide to creating sophisticated chatbots with Dialogflow CX, utilizing both foundational elements and advanced features.

**Connecting Documents**
![NotebookLM Connect Documents](https://github.com/chanpheakka/NotebookLM-Experiment/blob/main/NotebookLM_ConnectDocuments.png)

NotebookLM connects information across multiple documents, demonstrating its ability to synthesize information from various sources to form a cohesive understanding.

### 4. Study Guide Example

**Prompt**: "Give me an example with sources."

**NotebookLM Output**:
> Example of a Simple Chatbot: The "Breakfast Bot"
> - **Creating a New Page**: Set up the "Coffee" page to initiate user interaction.
> - **Routing from Start Page**: Route from the Start Page to the "Coffee" page.
> - **Adding Fulfillment**: Set fulfillment to ask, "Would you like some coffee?"
> - **Creating Intents**: Define "Yes" and "No" intents to understand the user’s response.
> - **Routing and Fulfillment**: Route based on intents to either continue or end the conversation.
> - **Testing**: Use the built-in testing tools to confirm functionality.

**Example with Sources**
